is freely available ar URL:

The RING method (first version) has been published in:

-------------------------------------------------

1 - Installation

RING works out of the box as it is. However to run it outside the
installation path you have to set an environment variable, VICTOR_ROOT.
For example if you have RING installed in the folder /home/user/ring
you can just run:

	export VICTOR_ROOT=/home/user/ring



-------------------------------------------------

2 - Execution and examples

To execute RING just reach the installation path and type:

	./bin/Ring -i <pdb_file>


By default RING-2.0 calculate contacts of the first chain and providing
interaction types (HBONDS, VDW, IONIC, SSBOND, PIPISTACK, PICATION).
To customize your calculation and for a complete list of RING parameters
just read the program help by typing:

	./bin/Ring -h

"help" pages).
